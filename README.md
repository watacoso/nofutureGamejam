# Work the Oppression
by NoFutureBuds for the No Future Game Jam

## Introduction
**Work the Oppression** is a local multiplayer co operative real-time game for up to 4 people. It allows the players to work together on oppressing the public in a dystopian orwellian future by combining powers to create the best possible powers for each battle.

## Description
The year is 2384 You start out along with your mates in the armory of the security area of a private surveillance company working for the state. You are told through the radio that riots are breaking out all over the complex and workers are retaliating. Even some security personnels have been spotted joining the enemy and it is your job to nullify the threat and take out the dissidents who clearly are the enemy of the state.

In the armory you choose a weapon (or suit?) lying around which will define your abilities, your class, and your playstyle. You pick up the *rifle*. As you do that a team mate joins the game, named Alice, she picks up the *shock club* and goes through the door. You follow.

You see several workers stand up from their workstations and they start walking towards you armed with blunt objects they found lying around, clearly planning to use them as weapons against you. Alice hits one of the enemies with her shock club, injuring him and right after you shoot and eliminate the second individual. The injured one gets demoralized and heads back to his workstation but Alice walks up to him and finishes him off. Better finish them off rather than risking them coming back at you.

You two head out of the room and into the next room where 2 workers and 1 security guard greet you in a very unfriendly way. Molotov cocktails are thrown at you and the enemy security guard starts firing at you with his pistol. Your current weapons and abilities might not be very effective in this situation but you two notice a couple of **modification stations**, one **shield station** and another **explosives station**. Alice heads to the **shield station** and activates it, augmenting her **shock club** with a shield. You augment your rifle with explosives at the **explosives station**. Alice slams down the club into the floor next to you and creates a shield to guard you two from the fire. And you shoot the security guard with your explosive rounds, taking out the guard and the other two workers standing next to him.

You decide that the shield augmentation would fit nicely with your rifle so you go to the **shield station** and replace your explosive rounds with the shield. Alice then replaces her shield augmentation with the explosives.

## Old Design Document
Game set in an orwellian dystopian future (with magic) where you play as the opressor. You are a security guard in a government run complex which employs the public but they are not happy. A strike/riot strikes out and they step away from their computers/workstations and start fighting the guards. You must restore order in each room and force them to work. Break down their spirit. (or kill them?)

A possible "twist" would be that in the end everyone is dead and nobody is left to work. Everybody lose.

The Players
The players play as the opressing security guards. Wearing something similar to welding helmets to conceil their identity. The players will have 3 or 4 classes to choose from.

Enemies
The enemies are the public armed with what is at hand. It would be interesting/controversial to use minority groups that have or are being opressed in one way or another in reality. Blacks, Women, Hispanics, and so on.
After enough enemies are taken out in each room, the spirit is broken and the rest returns to their desks/workstations to work. (although have the possibility of rioting again later). You can choose to kill them or let them work.

Gameplay
Each player has an analog stick for movement, one button for action and another for dropping and picking up items. The players start in an empty room and a computer tells them that the workers are rioting, they don't want to work. (security cam footage of rioting rooms perhaps?), Each player has a core attack/action respective to their class. Be it melee, ranged, aoe, et cetera. "Gems" can then be picked up to adjust and modify those actions to be offensive/defensive/supportive et cetera. The idea is that switching gems (one at a time) in battles can give you the upperhand.
The Gems

    Heal

    Shield

    Explosives

    Vampire

    Speed

The Classes

    Ranged Security Guard with gun/bow

    Melee Security Guard with a club

    Melee AoE Security Guard with a shockwave attack

If the ranged security guard gets Heal for example, he will be able to shoot his allies to give them health. The AoE security guard will be able to heal everyone around him, if the AoE security guard will pick up speed he will be able to attack faster with his standard AoE shockwave attack. Basically, each gem changes the effect of the projectile/shockwave/hit.
Idea
to simplify controls, instead of gems we would have colored areas in each room. if you step on an area it would mean the same as dropping your current gem and picking up a new gem. This could allow us to either only require one button (action) or give that second button another function. (potions?  dashing...? and so on)
