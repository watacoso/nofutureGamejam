if you want the code to work, you need to first execute some steps.

first, you need to import some external libraries. at the time of this note, the project is using:

gson-2.2.4.jar
slick.jar
jorbis-0.0.15.jar
jogg-0.0.7.jar
lwjgl.jar

take note that you need to link the native openGL files to lwjgl.jar
